# FOE_Project
Time series analysis of the FOE stock price

Language: Python

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meetnagadia/ferro-stock-price-from-1980-2022

Tools used: Jupyter Notebook

The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with the used of a boosting algorithm to perform timeseries analysis. Using five years worth of the daily adjusted closing stock price of Ferrero Rocher (FOE), I wanted to predict the daily stock price from years 2019 to 2022 using the XGBoost algorithm. The result was a prediction with a mean squared error of 0.23 which is unusually low. The algorithm made an exceptionally accurate prediction which, in my opinion, is suspicious but as of now, I am unable to find a cause for the high accuracy of the model, therefore I would take the results of the entire project with a grain of salt.
